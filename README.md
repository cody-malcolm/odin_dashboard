#### Specifications

##### Main

##### Main

1. Don't be a perfectionist
 * The page is just supposed to look like ~~Google's~~ The Odin Project's page, not function like it
 * Spacing just needs to *similar*, not down to the pixel.
 * Dropdown menus, form submissions, and hover-highlighting should be ignored
2. Do as much as you can before viewing the page's source code or relying on Dev Tools
3. When complete, project should be pushed to GitHub. Git should be used for Version Control.

##### Optional

4. Submit a pull request to contribute this solution to The Odin Project.

##### Ambiguous

5. Should the project be mobile responsive?

#### Learning Objectives

This project is designed to facilitate practice towards mastery of HTML and CSS. In addition, it allows for practice creating and modifying a Version Control project with Git and GitHub. This is comparable to the "hard" version of the Google page project.

#### Preliminary Thoughts

The usual project is to create a clone of the Google Search Results page using HTML and CSS. However, [I already did this a couple of years ago](https://github.com/codyMalcolm/google_homepage). Now that I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student, I decided to pick back up where I left off. However, I don't want to jump right back into the middle of Ruby on Rails without refreshing myself on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so I decided to redo the early projects from scratch. In the case of this project, however, I wasn't eager to do the exact same page again, so after a bit of thinking I decided to do a comparably complex page, and what better page to do then the Odin Project dashboard?
